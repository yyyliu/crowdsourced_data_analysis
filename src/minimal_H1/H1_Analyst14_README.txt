*************************************************Please note: 

Analyst 14 originally obtained an effect size of 0.000246 (positive and
not significant). We also independently re-ran Analyst 14's code twice:
first in 2018 and then again in 2019. Both times we obtained exactly the
same effect size (we saved a screenshot of the 2018 analysis in Airtable)

I re-ran the code today and now obtained a result of ES = 0.0011 (also
positive and also not significant, like the ES reported by Analyst 14). 

I think this slight difference in the effect size obtained can be
explained by slightly different data-splitting functions that are now
implemented in R.
