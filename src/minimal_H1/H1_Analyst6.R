#Test hypothesis 1: "A womanâ€™s tendency to participate actively in the conversation correlates positively with the number of females in the discussion".

#Consider making this into a function?
library(tidyverse)
dat <-read_csv('../data/edge1.1_anonymized.csv')

#One thing to try: for each individual woman in the dataset, calculate an average number of comments per discussion that she's in.
#Then, for those women, calculate how that summary statistic relates to number of women in a conversation.
women <- dat %>% filter(Female == 1) %>% 
  select(Title, Name, Id, PreviousContributions, PreviousThreads, ContributionsThisYear, ThreadsThisYear) %>%

#Now, for each conversation, get the number and percent of females.

#Join data for regression.

#that individual participated very actively in one discussion after previously "lurking" 8 times. 
#Redo regression without her.
